<p>The main purpose of the project is investigating the viability of cargo bicycles as a solution for urban
    logistics with subsequent application in urban logistics tasks in conditions of Almaty.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>In the city of Almaty, where most of the streets are narrow, with high road traffic and classic
                delivery methods are difficult, cargo bicycles are the best method. Cargo bikes are bicycles
                equipped with a box for transporting freight. When it comes to parcel delivery, cargo bikes are
                particularly suitable for small, light consignments, which are currently on the increase, especially
                for deliveries to private customers (B2C). Cargo bikes will be a key solution in last mile delivery
                issue</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of use and the problem that the delivery with the help of cargo bicycles must
    solve is the reduction of emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Expected result of the pilot project is implementation of a test cargo bike delivery between two buildings of DKU
    for the transportation of the goods and necessary items in the educational process. Develop an urban logistics
    application for the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP)</p>

            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>Bicycles and cycle logistics have established themselves in the public discourse on the design of
                urban transport and urban logistics. The city of Almaty has ambitious plans to improve the
                sustainability of the urban transport system. SUMP of the city of Almaty provides comprehensive
                guidance on cycling development</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</div>

<p>Objectives of the project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare analysis and evaluation of cargo bike transport vs. other means of transports in Almaty in terms of
        economic and ecological aspects</li>
    <li>Cargo bike has been tested in operation at local partners, with Gebrüder Weiß</li>
    <li>Organize a cargo bike route course between two University buildings with positive externalities for DKU and
        LogCentre DKU</li>
    <li>Create a digital platform for manage cargo bikes</li>
    <li>Share knowledge about urban logistics solutions and planning principles</li>
    <li>Encourage stakeholders to create new urban logistics systems</li>
</ul>
